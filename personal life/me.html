            <h2>Childhood</h2>
            <img src="fam.jpg.jpg">
            <p>One of my most cherished childhood memories revolves around our annual family camping trips. Every holiday, my parents would pack up the car with tents, sleeping bags, and a seemingly endless supply of snacks. We'd venture into the great outdoors, away from the hustle and bustle of city life.

                One particular year stands out vividly in my mind. We camped near a picturesque lake surrounded by lush greenery. As the sun set, we gathered around the campfire, roasting marshmallows and sharing stories. The crackling flames cast dancing shadows on our faces, and the air was filled with laughter and the distinct scent of burning wood.
                
                During that trip, my parents taught me how to set up a tent and build a proper campfire. These seemingly simple activities were profound lessons in self-reliance and resourcefulness. I learned to appreciate the value of teamwork as we collaborated to cook meals and navigate the trails.
                
                Those camping trips became a yearly tradition, shaping my love for nature and instilling a sense of adventure. The experiences fostered a deep connection with my family, creating bonds that have lasted a lifetime. Even today, the smell of a campfire instantly transports me back to those carefree holiday nights and the warmth of family togetherness.
                
                .</p>
            <p>I had a very happy and eventful childhood. I grew up in a small town with my loving parents and 12 siblings. We spent our days swimming in the lake, hiking in the woods, and camping under the stars.</p>
            <p>One of my favorite childhood memories is when I learned how to ride a bike. I was so excited to finally be able to ride with my friends. I spent hours practicing in the driveway until I could finally ride without wobbling.</p>

In my high school years, I maintained a GPA well above the average, earning a spot on the honor roll every subject. This commitment to academic excellence reflects my dedication to learning and intellectual growth.

                One of my proudest academic accomplishments was graduating for my diploma. My project, which explored the intersection of biology and technology, not only garnered recognition but also fueled my passion for scientific inquiry. This experience taught me the importance of curiosity and perseverance in the face of challenges.
                
                Beyond the classroom, my involvement in extracurricular activities has played a crucial role in shaping my character. I was an active member of the football team .Serving as the team captain in my senior year, I led our squad to victory in several regional competitions, solidifying my commitment.
                
                In addition to academic and extracurricular success.</p>
            <p>I attended Zetech university where I majored in DIT. I graduated with honors and was also a member of the HUAWEI Organization].</p>
